Assignment -1 Report 

Smart-Mart E-commerce website

HomePage : index.html

Additional Features: 

1.CSS hover effects on top and side menu have been added.

2.My Orders : myitems.html 
On this page, I have tried not to use the table to display the items.Rather I have chosen to display it in bootstrap standard rows and columns as it enhances performance.It is widely known that the <table> reduces the overall page performance.


This page has been associated with the My Orders link on the top menu.
   


3.Product Page : item.html
Added “Watch Now” button and link for buying the movie product

4. HomePage - index.html
Included “Sign up to become an individual seller” to promote sellers to sign up as vendors

5.FavIcon has been set.

6.Document name been added to be able to identify the document in the browser tab.




CHALLENGES:

 I had first designed the website with the help of iframes but had to convert it back to standalone html pages.
Main challenge was to find an ideal alignment for the contents.
Displaying the right elements in the right size and find the appropriate color combinations was a challenging task.
Alignment issues while trying to perform cross browser UI testing especially on Mozilla.
